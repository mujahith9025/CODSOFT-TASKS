Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at CodSoft. It focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using Machine Learning techniques. The analysis is performed on the popular Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Problem Statement

The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, gender, class, and more.

Algorithms Used

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier

Key Steps in the Notebook

Data loading and exploration
Missing value treatment
Feature engineering
Data visualization
Model training and evaluation
Accuracy comparison

Model Accuracy

Each model was evaluated for its accuracy. The Random Forest Classifier gave the highest accuracy among all tested algorithms.

Requirements

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Sample Output

Model performance and visualizations are available in the notebook. Key insights and charts include:
Heatmaps of missing values
Survival rate by gender and class
Confusion matrix and accuracy scores
