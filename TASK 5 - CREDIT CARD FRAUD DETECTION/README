Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is a part of my Data Science Internship at CodSoft. It focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques.

Objective

To build a machine learning model that can effectively detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on anonymized features and transaction time/amount.

Techniques Used

Data Preprocessing
Handling class imbalance using under-sampling or SMOTE
Feature scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing fraud vs non-fraud distribution
Correlation analysis
Model Building
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Isolation Forest or XGBoost (optional)
Evaluation Metrics

Key Highlights

Real-world imbalanced dataset (fraud cases are rare)
ROC-AUC Curve, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report used for evaluation
