Sales Prediction using Python

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at CodSoft. It involves building a regression model to predict sales based on advertising budgets in TV, radio, and newspaper.

Objective

To predict the sales of a product based on the amount spent on advertising across three different media:
TV
Radio
Newspaper

Techniques Used

Data cleaning and preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation analysis
Regression modeling using:
Linear Regression
Model evaluation

Key Highlights

Heatmaps and scatter plots for visualization
Fitting  linear model to the data
Comparison of actual vs predicted sales
Use of regression metrics to evaluate performance

Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
RÂ² Score

Requirements

numpy  
pandas  
matplotlib  
seaborn  
scikit-learn

Dataset

The dataset used is advertising.csv which includes columns for advertising spend and corresponding sales. It should be placed in the dataset/ folder.
