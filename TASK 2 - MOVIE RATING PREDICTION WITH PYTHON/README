Movie Rating Prediction with Python

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at CodSoft. It focuses on predicting IMDb movie ratings based on a variety of features using Python and machine learning techniques.

Objective

To build a regression model that can predict the IMDb rating of a movie using features such as genre, director, cast, runtime, votes, and more.

Techniques Used

Data preprocessing
Feature engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation matrix and visualizations
Model training with:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, R² Score)

Key Highlights

Handling of missing values
Label encoding for categorical data
Use of regression models for prediction
Visual insights on rating distribution, correlation, and feature importance

Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

Requirements

numpy  
pandas  
matplotlib  
seaborn  
scikit-learn

Dataset

You can use the dataset named IMDb Movies India.csv which should be placed inside the dataset/ folder. This dataset contains information about Indian movies and their IMDb ratings.
