Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at CodSoft. It involves classifying iris flowers into different species using machine learning techniques based on their petal and sepal dimensions.

Objective

To build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an iris flower from its measurements:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

Techniques Used

Data preprocessing and visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Classification models:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Accuracy evaluation and comparison

Key Highlights

Visualizations with seaborn and matplotlib
Pairplot and correlation heatmaps
Confusion matrix for model evaluation
Accuracy comparison between multiple classifiers

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix

Requirements

numpy  
pandas  
matplotlib  
seaborn  
scikit-learn

Dataset

The dataset used is IRIS.csv, which contains labeled flower data. It should be placed inside the dataset/ folder.
